## Project Motivation
I wanted to know what some variables were involved in knowing a developer's Job and Career Satisfaction. In my current role, understanding unit costing and the cost to replace individuals is very high. Good developers are extremely important to furthering my company's future goals. Knowing some of the variables that go into what keeps developers happy is vital to understanding why some developers leave. Furthermore, understanding if companies are at a dissadvantage for simply being the company that they are will help to understand if additional offered benefits are required to keeping good developers. 

To do this, I used the 2019 Stackoverflow Survey results which contains more than 90,000 respondents. You can find the link to the data here [https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey].

## File Descriptions
The analysis work was completed in a Jupyter Notebook named: survey_results.ipynb. There is also an html file with the same information called: survey_results.html
